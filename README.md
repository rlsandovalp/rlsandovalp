## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you’ll find a collection of the code I've developed for both past and ongoing projects.

- ⛰️ I’m currently working on the development of an integrated surface/subsurface flow model for the Po River district in northern Italy. The model is being built using **ParFlow** and will be used to simulate water dynamics in the region under various climate change and groundwater pumping scenarios. The repositories containing the code for this project are currently private, as the work is still in progress. Once the first scientific articles are published, these repositories will likely be made public.

- 🤖 I’m currently learning about **simulation-based inference** to accelerate the stochastic calibration of hydrological models.

- 🌊 I’m interested in collaborating on the application of stochastic techniques in large-scale numerical water models.

- 🤔 I’m looking for support in developing methods to quantify uncertainty in **LSTM-based river discharge predictions**.

- 💬 Ask me about **ParFlow!** I’ve been working with it for the past few years. While I still have a lot to learn, I’m confident I can help in many cases.

- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me a message on **LinkedIn**—I’ll be happy to connect and share advice.

- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him / His

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love **bouldering!**
